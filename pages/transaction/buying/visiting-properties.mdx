# Visiting Properties

Good real estate agents will listen to your wants and needs and arrange to show only those homes that fit your particular parameters. Also they quite often will even preview homes before showing them to you as well. With that in mind there should be no need to visit any more than a total of ten to fifteen properties and no more than four to five in any one day.

* Bring a digital camera and begin each series of photos with a close-up of the house number to identify where each group of home photos start and end.

* Take copious notes of unusual features, colors and design elements.

* Pay attention to the home's surroundings. What is next door? Do 2-story homes tower over your single story?

* Do you like the location? Is it near a park or a power plant?

* You should wear shoes that are easy to put on and take off you'll be doing that a lot.

* I suggest that on the initial first visits to leave the children at home if possible. You need to focus on the task at hand, to be able to have a thorough look around and to discuss matters with your realtor and your spouse or partner without interruptions.

* Bring a tape measure with you so you can verify room sizes and to make sure your furniture or bed will fit.

I'm counting on you having a building inspector go through the home if you do buy it. But here are a few things you can do if you think that a home could be a potential candidate. But leave the final call  based on your inspectors report.

* Flush the toilets specially the one on the lowest level to check its bowl's evacuation.

* Turn on taps at the same time you flush to check water pressure.

* Check the power panel board to make sure its at least 100 amp service (no fuses)

* View the furnace to check on its approximate age hopefully it's a high-efficiency furnace.

* If a room is carpeted take up a floor heating vent and check if the sub-floor is hardwood if that's important to you.

* If there's an area rug lift it a bit to check for floor damage, or major stains.

* Check the ceiling for water damage especially below bathrooms on upper floors.

* Take a look at walls and ceilings for obvious problem cracks

* Check the basement walls for water penetration.

* Outside take a quick look at the roof condition.

* Trees over-hanging the roof

* Check for ground surface grading away from the house

* Check windows for aging issues inside and outside.

* Check for "Kitec' Plumping!! (Blue or Orange colored pipes leading to washers or under sinks) Popular mainly in condo between 1995 and 2007  "Google Kitec Plumping"
Immediately after leaving, rate each home on a scale from 1 to 10 along with the most salient pro's and con's. Its good to do this right on the MLS listing data sheet. (ask the agent to provide you with a copy of the listing)
 
View Top Choices a Second Time before making an offer to buy that first home.
After touring homes for a few days, you will probably instinctively know which one or two homes you would like to buy. Ask to see them again. You will see them with different eyes and notice elements that were overlooked the first go-around. Don't be surprised at this as you walk through a property for a second time because you're now viewing them with very critical eyes.
 
On that second visit many buyers like to take along a trusted friend or quite often parents. Its often good to have a second pair of eyes along that know you and your life style and as such may point out things your hadn't thought of. However be forewarned I've noticed a tendency of a few of these kind folks to think you brought them there to show their expertise in real estate by being very critical about the property and it price value, especially if they are somehow involved in the financing.
â€‹
Keep in mind that they did not go through the process of combing through the listings or visiting the many properties. They might not be even aware of real estate the prices today, they themselves may not have bought a home in quite some time.

At this point, your agent should call the listing agents to find out more about the sellers' motivation and to double-check that an offer hasn't come in, making sure these homes are still available to purchase.
I'll let you in on a little secret. I generally know which home a buyer is going to choose, and I suspect most other agents operate the same way. It's an intuition. But I make it a practice not to steer buyers, and I insist that buyers choose the home without interference from me. It's not my choice to make.  Real estate agents are required, however, to point out defects and should help buyers feel confident that the home selected meets the buyer's search parameters.
