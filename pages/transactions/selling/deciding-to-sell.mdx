# Understanding Your Decision To Sell!

I won't spend a lot of time on this subject, you know the reasons why you are thinking about selling and if you are a home owner chances are you wont run into too much trouble should you sell, providing there is adequate equity in your home.

That being said if you are NOT buying soon after selling, realize that the market could move away from you as prices rise and lock you out all together, particularly if you had a certain area you wanted to reside.

Following on that thought, even if you do buy right away and move to a less expensive area, with the aim of capturing some of the equity that had built up in your home, by keep in mind that you just may not be able to move back to your old neighborhood.

Before you move forward with selling your home, answer these questions:

* Why do I want to sell?
* What will a new home offer that my existing home canâ€™t?
* Can I afford to sell?
* Do I have enough equity in my home to make a down payment on a new house and/or achieve other financial goals?
* Do I need to sell within a certain amount of time?
* How much preparation or repair work do I need to do before my house is ready to sell?
* Is making a profit on the sale of my home one of my goals?
