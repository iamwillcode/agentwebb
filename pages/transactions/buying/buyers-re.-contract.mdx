# Signing The Realtors Contract

This must be signed first before any type of agency relationship is created "Working With A Realtor".

The “Working with a Realtor” brochure is simply a signed confirmation the Realtor has explained the different types of Agency Relationship to the client. By signing this brochure, the client is NOT BOUND TO THE REALTOR. It is simply a signed disclosure that the client has had their rights in the Agency Relationship explained as well as the Realtors obligations and responsibilities to the client in each type of agency relationship. Nothing more and it is signed as proof that they have read and understood it.
