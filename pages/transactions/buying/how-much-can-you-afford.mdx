## 36% Rule! Leaping Into Homeownership.

In order to avoid the nightmare scenario of buying a house that breaks the bank, you’ll need to figure out a housing budget that makes sense for you. When determining "How much house can I afford?" one rule of thumb to follow is the 36% rule.

This is more a rule of thumb than a strict limit, but most banks don’t like to make loans to borrowers with bad debt-to-income ratios. Although it’s possible to find lenders willing to do so (often at higher interest rates), the thinking behind the rule is instructive.

If you are spending 40% or more of your pre-tax income on pre-existing obligations, a relatively minor shift in your income or expenses could wreak havoc on your budget. Banks don’t like to lend to borrowers who have a low margin of error. That’s why your pre-existing debt will affect how much home you qualify for when it comes to securing a mortgage.

But it isn’t only in your lender’s interest to keep this rule in mind when looking for a house; it’s in yours too. Since lenders tend to charge higher interest rates to borrowers who break the 36% rule, you’ll probably end up spending more on interest if you go for a house that places you beyond that limit.


### The Down Payment and the Cash Reserve

Another key number in determining the answer to **How much house can I afford?** is your down payment. The larger the down payment, the larger the house, right? Well, yes, but before you go and empty out your savings account, keep in mind that lenders generally want you to have a cash reserve remaining after you’ve moved in.

**The Importance of a Cash Reserve**

Having some money in the bank after you buy is a great way to help ensure that you don’t find yourself worrying about the two dirty words in homeownership: default and foreclosure. The question isn’t just “Can I afford a house?” It’s “Can I afford a house and still have some money left over as a buffer?”

While maintaining a debt-to-income ratio under 36% protects you from minor changes in your finances, a cash reserve protects against major ones. At a minimum, it’s a good idea to be able to make three months’ worth of housing payments out of your reserve, but something like six months would be even better. That way, if you experience a loss of income and need to find a new job, or if you decide to sell your house, you have plenty of time to do so without missing any payments (and, in turn, wrecking your credit).

Think of your cash reserve as the braking distance you leave yourself on the highway—if there’s an accident up ahead, you want to have enough time to slow down, get off to the side, or otherwise avoid disaster.

A good home affordability calculator (like ours!) will make sure you have this cash reserve at the end of the homebuying process.


### Can I afford a house? vs. Should I buy a house?

Let's face it, buying a house is a big decision, and figuring out how much house you can afford can be overwhelming.

Some people might think that just because they qualify for a certain mortgage amount, it means they can afford that house. But hold up! There's more to consider than just the number a bank is willing to lend you.

The truth is, your financial situation is unique to you. It's not just about your income, credit rating, and savings. It's also about your personal goals and lifestyle. Do you want to travel? Save for retirement? Pay off other debts? All of these things need to be taken into account when figuring out how much house you can afford.

So, while it's important to use tools like home affordability calculators to help guide you, it's equally important to do your homework and think about what's right for you. 

After all, you're the one who has to make those mortgage payments every month. 

So, take the time to figure out what you can comfortably afford, and you might just find that the most expensive home isn't necessarily the best fit for your lifestyle.
